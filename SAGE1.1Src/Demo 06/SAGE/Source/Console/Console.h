/// \brief Provides a console allowing the user to type commands at

//
/*! 

A global Console object is created in console.cpp and is externed in 
console.h (this file). \n


To create a custom function:

1. Create a global function with the following prototype:

bool myFunction (ParameterList* ,string*);

2. Call the addFunction method to add the function.  
Your custom function will now be called when it is requested by the user

\n \n


When the custom function is called, the ParameterList* contains information
about the parameters.  If the custom function returns false, the string 
passed in will be printed to the console.  You are free to change this 
string to create your own custom error messages.

Example:

The following example creates a command, mytest, which takes 1 integer as
a parameter and is attached to function myFunction.  When a user types 
mytest followed by an integer myFunction is called  If the integer value
is greater than 10, an error message is printed to the console.  If it
is less than 10, a process is done.

 \code
bool myFunction (ParameterList* params,string* errorMessage)
{
	if (params[0]->Ints[0] > 10)
	{
		// dereference the point to the string and set it to a message
		(*errorMessage) = "Number is greater than 10 error!";
		
		// return error so that the errorMessage is printed to the console
		return false; 
	}
	
	// Do Something

	return true;
}

int AddMyFunction()
{
	
	// the "i" means that the command takes one integer as a parameter
	gConsole.addFunction("mytest","i",myFunction);

}
