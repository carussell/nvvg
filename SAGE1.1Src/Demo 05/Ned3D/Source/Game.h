/// Controls all game logic.  Game is derived from base class GameBase.
/// 4 Member functions are then overridden ( initiate(), shutdown(), 
/// renderScreen(), and process() ).  Although not reccomended, main() can
/// be overriden for more flexibility but we don't need to for NED3D.
/// The WindowsWrapper class will initiate the game engine and then call the 
/// initiate function in this calss.  It will then repetitively call the Main 
/// method (overridable) until the program terminates.  The main
/// method in GameBase simply checks for a lost device, updates input, calls 
/// process() (which is overriden here), and then calls renderScreen()
/// (also overriden).  Upon termination, the Shutdown method will be called.
