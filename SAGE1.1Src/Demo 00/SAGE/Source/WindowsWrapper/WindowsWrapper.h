/// The windows wrapper class.  This class isolates the game engine from windows.

/// \mainpage SAGE: A Simple Academic %Game Engine
///
/// Students learning game programming in academia need an engine that is flexible, extensible, stable, 
/// and well-documented. Industry game engines are production code, code that is designed merely to work.
/// An academic game engine should be written to be easy to understand and modify, especially to relatively
/// inexperienced students. It should obey the educational principle “Proceed from the known into the unknown”. 
///
/// SAGE consists of a game engine developed as a sequence of demos, each built on its predecessor, 
/// a process called incremental development. Incremental Development has been used by Ian Parberry 
/// in his game programming classes since 1993, and his 2000 and 2001 books on 2D game programming. 
/// SAGE brings this experience to a fully 3D game engine, based on an educational pedagogy that has a 
/// proven track record of placing students in the game industry. 
///
/// SAGE Version 1 demos include:
///
/// - Demo 0: %Model viewer
/// - Demo 1: %Terrain
/// - Demo 2: Shaders
/// - Demo 3: %Game engine architecture
/// - Demo 4: Collision detection
/// - Demo 5: %Particle engine
/// - Demo 6: Sound
///
/// SAGE is open source code released under the BSD license. It is written in C++ using Visual Studio 2005 and
/// DirectX 9.0. The SAGE website http://larc.csci.unt.edu/sage includes full source code, tutorials, and additional 
/// information. SAGE was created by faculty and students in the Laboratory for Recreational Computing, Department of
/// Computer Science & Engineering, University of North Texas. 
///
/// Credits: Ian Parberry (Principal Investigator), Jeremy Nunn, Joe Scheinberg, Erik Carson, Jason Cole.
///
/// If you make use of SAGE in your class or research project, and/or derive new works from it, we would love to
/// hear from you. Please contact Ian Parberry, contact information at http://www.eng.unt.edu/ian.
///
/// SAGE was funded by a grant from Microsoft Research.
